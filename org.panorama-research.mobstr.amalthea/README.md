# MobSTr AMALTHEA Models

This folder contains the AMALTHEA model for the MobSTr data set in three different stages. 

* [`original`](original): The original (unmodified) WATERS challenge model
* [`mapped`](mapped): A modified version of the WATERS challenge model that uses the mapping identified in [1] as a solution of the WATERS challenge
* [`mapped+safety`](mapped+safety): A refined version of the above model that - in addition to the mapping from [1] - reflects the additional safety mechanisms that have been introduced as part of MobSTr (see the [requirements](../org.panorama-research.mobstr.requirements) and the [MobSTr timing report](../org.panorama-research.mobstr.requirements/timing))
